- Side-by-side comparison bars for each hospital
- Clear identification of lowest and highest priced hospitals
- Interactive charts with proper tooltips and formatting

### **4. Real-Time Search Performance**
- Sub-second search across **169,391 medical items**
- Optimized pickle file storage for fast dataset loading
- In-memory search with keyword and code-based matching
- Supports complex queries with multiple code types

## **üí° Technical Innovations**

### **Cross-Hospital Matching Algorithm**
```python
def find_cross_hospital_matches(search_term, max_results=50):
    # 1. Parallel search across all hospital datasets
    # 2. Code normalization (especially NDC formatting)
    # 3. Grouping by medical code matches
    # 4. Price spread analysis and savings calculation
    # 5. Ranking by hospital coverage and savings potential
```

### **UCLA Code Extraction**
```python
def extract_hcpcs_from_ucla_code(code_value):
    # Pattern recognition: RRUCLA-XXXXXXXXXX-1000-HCPCS-XXXX
    # Validation of extracted codes
    # Integration with existing UCLA dataset
    # 3,289 new HCPCS codes successfully extracted
```

### **Price Analysis Engine**
- Calculates min/max prices across hospitals
- Computes price spreads and percentage differences
- Identifies potential savings opportunities
- Ranks results by savings potential
